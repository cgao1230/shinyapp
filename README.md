shinyapp
========
I did not submit my server.R and ui.R to github at the assignment stage. After I found the link is not working, I submited two 
files to github. Hopefully, the classmates who evaluated my assignment will go back to my github and re-evaluate my shiny app.
PS: I did re-evaluate one peer assignment which was not working at the first place.
